![demo screenshot](assets/demo.png)

The present repository hosts a highly configurable and extendable desktop graphical application to perform real-time detection of piano note onsets and velocities, developed in the context of the [IAMúsica](https://joantrave.net/en/iamusica/) project. Specifically, it provides the means to:
* Install the required software dependencies
* Configure and run the demo

See [this companion repository](https://github.com/andres-fr/iamusica_training) for details about the Deep Learning model used for the detections.
